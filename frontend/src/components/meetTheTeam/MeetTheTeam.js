            <h2>Ramon Vega</h2>
            <h3>Owner & Coach</h3>
            <p>My name is Ramon Vega. I started my journey in the fitness industry in 2013. 
            Much like many other trainers I started at a local corporate gym. 
            My continuous desire to grow my knowledge in health & fitness and to help others made me one of the most highly ranked trainers in the nation. 
            In 2017 I decided to venture out on my own and started my own Personal Training business. 
            My goal is to help as many people as I can understand the importance of fitness and to provide a safe environment to anyone who comes in. 
            I specialize in sports performance development and love helping athletes develop the skills necessary to play college or professional sports.

            <p>My name is Cristina Vega, and I am one of the founders of Powerhouse Fitness. 
                I specialize in weight loss and women’s fitness. 
                I have experience with adolescent teens, women who are pregnant and postpartum. 
                I have a great appreciation for a womens’ body and what it is capable of going through. 
                My goal is to help women understand and learn how to be gentle and caring with themselves. 
                I tailor my clients workouts to their personal goals and abilities. 
                I am also a culinary student, which has allowed me to take in depth continuing education courses in nutrition. 
                I strive to help my clients understand how nutrition fuels your body. 
                I love training, educating, and all the challenges that come with helping my clients adapt.

            <p>Hello! I’ve been into fitness for 7+ years and counting. 
                I enjoy almost any sport, outdoor or physical activities. 
                One thing I’ve learned through all my life of “fitnessing,” is that character always comes first.
